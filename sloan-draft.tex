%% Acquisition of Mathematical Content from Textbooks in the Public Domain.

Dear Dr.~Weber:

In response to the report \emph{Developing a 21st Century Global Library
for Mathematics Research} and the corresponding Global Digital
Mathematics Library initiative we wish to propose a project 
for funding by Sloan.

The project aims to fill a critical gap
in the state of retro-digitised mathematical literature
wherein mathematical formulas are intentionally omitted, 
and thereby inaccessible to researchers and computational software.
\textbf{We aim to build a prototypical workflow for the comprehensive 
recognition, correction
and curation of digitised mathematical literature in the public domain 
by leveraging existing infrastructure.} In particular, we want to pursue 
the following goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify scholarly monographs and journals that are in the
  public domain, and that may have a suitable preliminary
  digitizations (i.e., scanned with basic text OCR).
\item Develop a robust process for an initial formula recognition from scanned 
documents, by employing and, where relevant, extending, existing OCR systems 
specialising in mathematics, such as {\sf Infty}.
\item Enable 
the manual correction of recognised mathematical formulae via crowdsourcing 
technology like Zooniverse's {\sf Scribe}.
\item Investigate and implement further enhancements leveraging
experience from the EuDML project, e.g., 
interlinking formulas and definitions within and between documents and
external sources  (arXiv, Wikipedia, Mathworld, PlanetMath, Peer 
Library).
\end{enumerate}
The resulting digitized mathematical content will be directly useful
for practitioners and learners as well as historians and other
scholars. As the first large-scale mathematical ``citizen science''
project we believe this project can nurture a community for future
digitization and enhancement activities.  We envision the workflow
outlined above serving as an engine for the creation of high-quality,
fully accessible mathematical content in the future global digital
mathematics library.

We estimate that the project will require 3 developer years spread over 2.5
calendar years.  We plan to split this time across five developers and
include support for the project manager, technical assistance with
acquisitions and processing, and dissemination of the results.
\textbf{The total costs are estimated to be \$544,000, over three phases:
(I.~Library infrastructure) \$148,000;
(II.~Content)               \$248,000;
(III.~Community features)   \$148,000.}

The primary contact for the group is \textsc{Peter Krautzberger}
(American Mathematical Society, USA).    Other
key members of the project are \textsc{Volker Sorge} (University of Birmingham, UK), \textsc{Raymond
  Puzio} (Albert Einstein College of Medicine \& PlanetMath.org, Ltd.,
USA), \textsc{Joseph Corneli} (Goldsmiths College, University of
London, UK \& PlanetMath.org, Ltd., USA), and \textsc{Mitar
  Milutinovic} (PeerLibrary \& UC Berkeley, USA).

In addition, we are supported by \textsc{Thomas Fischer} (Universiut{\"a}tsbibliothek
G{\"o}ttingen, DE), \textsc{Michael Furlough} (Hathi Trust, USA), \textsc{Dan Cohen} (Digital Public Library of America, USA), and \textsc{Robert Simpson} (Zooniverse, UK).
