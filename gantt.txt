;;; Phase 1:
;; Can we bring in HT for initial phase, and metadata about books that have not been renewed.
;; A1, and A2 types of public domain, HT best for A2.
;; old journals as well
;; (* 40 4 21 (* 18 0.25 ))15120.0

;;; Phase 2:
;; Even given Infty now, anything we do should be a bonus
;; Based on Calculus-book experience, the book may take 30 to 100 hours to fix up, ideally we'd like to improve that workflow (not writing a new OCR engine).

;;; Phase 3:
;; How to get the different software working together?  E.g. would we
;; be able to get ShareLaTeX into it?  
;; "Integrate all of the things we built in phase 1 with things that provide an interface that people can use."
;; - maybe develop another rendering tool in ShareLaTeX
;; de-emph pre/post processing, fold that into proofreading
;; - sample books: organizing, proof reading, cross-index, in Germany TOC not in copyright
;; Need a point (E) that deals with organizing things by TOC.

;;; List of software that we find helpful.
;;; List of content that we find interesting.
;;; Acquisition list, e.g. the GTM list
